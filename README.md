Do you know the health state of your wind farm assets?

This is a question every owner of wind farms and manufacturer of wind turbines should ask themselves. Unplanned costs due to failures, make up more than half of total maintenance costs, and the simple truth is: only a reliable plant earns money. Continuous and automated online monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics will be the main tools to lower maintenance costs and optimize the power and structural performance of wind turbine fleet.


RTDT makes condition and structural health monitoring of wind energy assets effortless for engineers, managers, and non-experts. Our technology stack lowers the barriers to entry to users and enhances their capabilities to deploy scalable research-based state-of-the-art models to extract deep interpretable and actionable insights, in minutes, in a no-code environment.


Towards this end, RTDT conducts fundamental, long-term R&D toward the creation of safe and reliable wind turbines.
